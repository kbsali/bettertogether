              <h1>Support for CLAs</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Recently, you introduced <a href="https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines" target="_blank">support for providing guidelines for contributions</a>. This lowers the barrier for pull requests, and also ensures that every new submission to a repo is consistent, clean, and at a high standard.</p>
            <p>You should provide a way for organizations to manage their Contributor License Agreement. Too often, CLAs are handled by users "signing" and emailing PDFs to a repo organizer, who then adds their name to a spreadsheet. Contributors are harrangued about whether "they've signed the CLA yet." Sometimes, submitters that send in a top-notch pull request drop off the face of the earth, leaving the code unmerged (and in a legal quagmire!).</p>
            <p><strong class="hl">Adminsitrators of organizations should be visually notified within the pull request  whether the submitter has signed a CLA.</strong> The user making the pull request should know that as part of the pull request process, they're abiding by the CLA.</p>

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gjtorikian/status/224260540283891712" target="_blank">I've complained about the old notification system for awhile</a>. The new updates are simple, concise, and I like being able to keep track of every contribution and repo made by other members of my organization.</p>

              <div class="media-body">
                <p>There's just one problem: any time I click on a notification, it's instantly marked as read, and tucked away into an "All notifications" black hole.</p>
                
                <p>If I need to refer to a notificaiton I read, I can't really easily find it. I can't search through my notifications. I can't tag my notifications the same way I can tag my issues. Heck, if an issue is tagged, and I'm being notified about it, I should be able to at least see the tag in my Notifications Center without opening it up.</p>
              
                <p><strong class="hl">Notifications should be more like email. If I click on a notification, it shouldn't disappear.</strong> It should go away when I tell it to&mdash;sort of like archiving it. If I want to sort my notifications by labels, let me do so.</p>

            </div>
            <p>If you don't want to make notifications like email messages, that's totally fine. But please <a href="https://github.com/blog/967-github-secrets" target="_blank">publicize the email address rules</a> in a format outside of a blog post.</p>

              <h1>Rework the Network Graph</h1>
            </div>
            <p>The Network Graph of forks is really awesome. I've used it several times to see what other contributions developers have made to a code base.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked" target="_blank">chjj's marked repo</a> is a good example of the usefulness of the Network Graph. It's a JavaScript implementation of the GitHub-Flavored-Markdown. Let's say a user wants definition list support, similar to <a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#def-list" target="_blank">PHP Markdown Extra</a>. But chjj doesn't want to implement that. That's completely fine; another user forks his project and implements the change. I can then browse other forks and decide which feature I want and need and use those implementations. It's a wonderful example of open-source development.</p>
            <p><strong class="hl">There are just a few usability issues with the graphs</strong>:
              <ol>
                <li>Consider highlighting commits or forks that implement features the main repository does not want. For example, if <code>#31</code> automatically links to a repo's issue #31, perhaps some other format could link to a forked repo (and highlight it on the original repo)</li>
                <li>Get rid of <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/74#issuecomment-9252246" target="_blank">useless "+1" comments</a> by adding a "thumbs up" counter. Allow for the ability to completely close threads; if the author doesn't want to implement the feature, it should be made abundently clear. <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/" target="_blank">Don't make the users do shit work</a> by endlessly justifying their programming decisions or assuaging the frustrations of their userbase.</li>
                <li>Navigation on the Network Graph is a painful experience, the least problematic of which being that the up-and-down arrow keys often interfere with the browser's scroll bar.</li>

            </div>
            <p>You're using Ace to provide inline edits to files. Terrific! <a href="https://www.github.com/ajaxorg/ace" target="_blank">Ace is an incredible online code editor</a>. <small>(Disclaimer: <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">I contribute to Ace</a>.)</small></p>

                <p>However, <strong class="hl">what is up with the horrendous white-on-black with minimal highlighting</strong>? The Ace editor is capable of so much more, on top of which, the color scheme is <em>really</em> unappealing. Why not provide the ability to set the themes, or improve the "Find" feature off of its default pop-up dialog mode?</p>

                <p>For quick fixes, the inline editor is a wondeful tool, particularly in environments where git isn't installed on a machine (mobile phone, anyone?).</p>

            <p>You present yourself as a social coding site, and your contributions to open-source development cannot be stressed enough.</p>
            <p>Why not go the extra step and <strong class="hl">provide a map of nearby developers</strong>? You know which languages I like to work in most; you can also know my location (if I choose to tell you). Perhaps you should also suggest nearby hu-mans for collaborative hacking?</p>
            <p>I'm not proposing you pivot into Facebook for Nerds. But if me and three other people have forked the same repository, and we've all made pull requests for it, it's be nice to have the opportunity to hash out some more ideas in person.</p>

            <p>It's tremendously easy to generate wikis and GitHub pages. I'd like to see you also <strong class="hl">make it tremendously easy to create API documentation</strong>. Nothing too fancy; just click a button, parse my repository, and provide a list of public classes and members. If I, the developer, want to provide further improvements, then it's my responsibility to do so. But if I just don't have the time, it becomes incredibly useful for anyone stumbling around to get a list of what my code can do.</p>
            <p>This becomes incredibly relevant for languages with members spread across various files.</p>

            <p>I'm absolutely thrilled that every time I've contacted GitHub Support, I've gotten a human being to respond. Bothering them with these ideas didn't seem like the right channel. Through this website, I hope to get through to a real life human being.</p>
